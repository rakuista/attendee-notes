Daniel Stevens, Atlasssian, @dan_stevens9190

- My path to Atlassian
    - Healthcare learning to observe
    - Univ Minnesota, learning to rhetoric
    - IBM, learning to user structure, systems, process
    - Medtronic, learn to appreciate the importance of specifics (little tiny details matter a lot)
    - Kroll Ontrack, learn to survive a challenge and take a big risk
    - Went to Atlassian
- From QA to design
    - What do we believe tech writing is? what does it mean to us? where does it need to go?
    - Devs write great code, find out what works, make it repeatable and spread it across the world
    - Wins:
        - building a culture where information is an essential part of the experience
        - expanding the team with researchers, developers, and designers
        - sharing skills and learning from each other
    - Frustrations
        - adopting new ways of thinking
        - staying focused on providing great docs
            - easy to get distracted by the shiny thing in the corner like user testing or screenshots or videos
        - what is our team in this new world
    - Hopes
        - everyone who delivers information is telling the same story
        - information is through about in every way it impacts anyone who is using or wants to use our products
        - combine design, research, data analytics, and great tech writing
        - deliver great information experiences in exactly the right place, time, and manner
- Resistance to change
    - it‚Äôs hard, not impossible
    - resistance vs motivation
        - we stay stuck in patterns? so stage change so people can adjust
        - if it isn‚Äôt broken, why fix it? constantly show value of change
        - I don‚Äôt think I can do that‚Ä¶ so enhance existing skills
    - give everyone some cake - reward their passions
- Making Confluence behave
    - Design influence on existing tools
    - connect, integrate, and develop
        - connect with plugin vendors to get help building solutions
        - integrate with tools that help them measure and understand
        - develop custom solutions as needed
- What IX means to me (not just a fancy title) (information experience)
    - Information experience
    - a new way of thinking about information
    - Gathering data so that you know ahead of time what your docs look like
    - set direction for the docs and the team
    - measuring results
    - writing for platforms
    - work like designers
        - do card-sorting
        - ‚Äúcontent sparring‚Äù
    - connecting stories
        - respond to a how-to blog post with a tutorial
    - you always feel at home when you get to any piece of content from Atlassian
    - Working with every other team to create a great information experience
        - Marketing teams
            - redesign homepage and copy on the page that shows up before people access the app
        - Product teams
        - Design teams
            - designers have final say on some things, IX team has final say on other aspects
        - Engineering teams
    - Most of the IX team is writers
        - sometimes you have to act like content strategists or designers or PM or support or engineers or data scientists or or or
        - tech writer can get into almost every office -
- Where we are going
    - influence all the things
        - connect marketing to support
        - connect product to design
        - created an IX toolkit üòç
        - voice and tone card
