#### Interactive Documentation Environments
* Code + Docs + Notes
 * Helps the user by putting the code, documentation, and user notes in a readable format, in one place. Assists the user when they get stuck learning a new programming language or writing code.
* Core Features
 * Live code.
 * Pretty formatting.
 * Ability to add new notes.
 * Media rich (GIFs, video)
 * Real programming, not a wrapper.


#### Swift Playgrounds
* Interactive Swift coding environment.
* Each statement is evaluated and displayed.
* Designed for prototypes, experiments, and learning.
* Can be paginated for structure.
* Supports Markdown and HTML.


#### IPython Notebooks
* Interactive Python coding environment.
* Similar to Swift Playgrounds.
* Designed for academic and scientific documentation.
* Supports text, equations, and graphs.


#### Project Jupyter
* Successor to IPython.
* Supports multiple languages.
* Used by O'Reilly Media for *Oriole*.


#### Strengths
* Code, documentation, and user's notes are together on-screen.
* Dynamic, make changes *on the fly*.
* Multimedia.


#### Weaknesses
* Only Markdown and HTML.
* Buggy.
* Limited language and framework support.
* Does not integrate with documentation tools.
* Only works for narratives.


#### Future
* The technology will improve.
* Easier to add new languages and projects.
* Replace or become books and articles.
* Better support for non-narrative documentation.
* More integration with video and screen-sharing.
