Code + docs + notes

people get lost - they get messed up while trying to learn
‚Äúwhat we‚Äôre saying, what they‚Äôre trying to do, and what is actually happening and they just get lost"

‚Äúinteractive documentation environments"

lets you take comment-riddled code that is hard to learn from and make it into something more

documentation that sits alongside code and lets you preview what‚Äôs actually showing up

the code + the person‚Äôs own notes + docs = one cohesive thing
üòç

Interactive Documentation Environment examples

- Swift playgrounds
- Jupyter notebooks

live code (can see it in real-time) + pretty formatting + add new notes + media rich (add gifs, videos, etc.)
it‚Äôs real programming not a special wrapper

playgrounds not learngrounds
can be paginated so you can separate things
supports markdown and HTML

IPython notebooks

- interactive python coding
- works the same as swift playgrounds
- supports text, equations, and graphs
- not built to learn/document, rather built to show what you did

Project Jupyter

- used by O‚ÄôReilly Media in regex golf e.g., https://www.oreilly.com/learning/regex-golf-with-peter-norvig
- supports multiple languages

What are the strengths of an interactive doc env?

- code and docs literally together - not just code examples, real code
- notes also there too
- can change things on the fly
- mixed media

Weaknesses

- only support markdown(ish) and HTML(ish)
- Kinda crashy
- limited language and framework support
- no real easy way to add your own programming languages or APIs to these things ‚Äî hard to do without tech background
- doesn‚Äôt hook into existing doc tools
- also only really works for narratives with step by step stuff

Apple recommends swift library writers to document their stuff in playgrounds but doesn‚Äôt say how they expect you do it

what‚Äôs next

- tech will improve
- be easier to add in new languages and projects
- more integration with video and screensharing
