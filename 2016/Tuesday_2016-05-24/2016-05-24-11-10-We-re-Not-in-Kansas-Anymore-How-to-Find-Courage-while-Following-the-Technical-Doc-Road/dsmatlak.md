#### Talk to your team about your documentation
* Your team are the QA, Dev Ops, Tech Support people that you speak with everyday for help with documentation and who rely on your documentation.
* Attend Stand-ups.
* Meet with stakeholders and internal customers.
* Get feedback from your team and customers about their expectations for your documentation. Helps to develop your content plan.


#### Be Vulnerable
* Being Vulnerable is not only a willingness to be wrong, but a willingness to be wrong in public.
* Be open and honest when you give feedback and when you get feedback.
* Compromise. It is not about whether your sentence is perfect, it is about clarity and helping people.
* Collaborate with your teams.


#### Make a plan
* Goals help with guidance to help you stay focused.
* Do research to build confidence for your goals and your writing.
 * Ask your self `why did I ______?`
 * Remain flexible to improve your output.


#### Practice sharing all the time; share with everyone
* Find a person whose opinion scares you the most and practice sharing with that person.
* Practice design critique: rules to get and give feedback.
 * Listen, gather data, and ask questions to clarify.
  * When you are getting feedback, do not justify to others, just gather the data, then review the data with your team to decide how to use feedback.
  * Expect some feedback to be positive, embrace the positive feedback. If you do not get positive feedback, give yourself feedback.


#### Nothing is perfect
* Imposter syndrome. We all have it.
* Acknowledge adversity.
 * Remember your biggest challenges, personal or work-related, while your wrote the document. And recall how you overcame those challenges.

**The point of technical documentation is not perfection... it's helping people.**

**Documents are better and stronger with a Team.**
