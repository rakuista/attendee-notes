Christy Lutz, technical communicator, @canncrochet

- Travel with friends!
    - talk to QA and engineering
- Talk to your team
    - Instead of telling people a content plan, ask them what they need.
    - go to standups!
- Be vulnerable
    - expect your team to be open and honest with you in feedback to your documentation
    - pick your fights - compromise. clarity and helping others > perfect sentences
- Collaborate
    - they help you and you can help them
- Make a plan
    - what is the goal?
    - keep plans somewhere you can refer to them to give you courage
- Do research
    - more confidence in your goals if you do research
    - did someone else already solve the problem you’re trying to solve?
    - “why did I lay out my page this way?"
- share your work with everyone
    - practice sharing with everyone
    - read it out loud
    - find a person whose feedback scares you the most and share it with them
- practice design critique
    - identify project stakeholders and goals
    - share goals and gather feedback
    - listen to the feedback without justification
    - then you get to decide what to do with the feedback
    - compare feedback to your goals
        - if the feedback doesn’t support the goals, it’s outside scope
- expect positive feedback
- we all have imposter syndrome
- acknowledge adversity
    - acknowledge what you’ve been through and that you overcame challenges
- accept that nothing is perfect
    - the point is not perfection, it’s helping people
