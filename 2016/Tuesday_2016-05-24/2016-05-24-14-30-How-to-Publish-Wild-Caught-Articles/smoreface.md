how publish content from community submitters? a wild article?

- the author didn’t have to write it
- the editor had to catch it!

Why and how to catch wild articles

- Why?
    - the public knows more
    - authors are your fans

Not cheaper and not faster to publish articles this way - takes about 90 days from contact to publish

Why do community authors write?

- share expertise!
- earn payment and swag
- work with an editor
- build reputation

can get clients through the articles they write

Readers benefit from authors who are a lot like them

HOW

- solicit samples from potential authors
- collect topics and outlines
- review drafts
- publish content

FINDING AUTHORS

- use social media
- link from the website
- blog post announcing the project (if your blog has a decent readership)
- support ticket turned doc
- posts about you
- contributors to your project
- freelance websites

SCREENING AUTHORS

Look for 3 things

- tech expertise (do they know what they’re talking about?)
- used to ask them for topic ideas? Now ask to submit SSH keys as a shibboleth for sysadmin skillz
- Writing ability? - ESL issues and grammar and typos are easy-to-remedy. Look for ability to explain things well, good sense of structure, a good tone, etc.
- Personality -

If you turn someone down, remember they’re still your fan - reward them with swag still!

* Always ask for topics with the sample
* coming up with topics is really hard
* asking for an outline helps the draft process down the line
* curate your topics

once you get a draft

- test and edit
- check for grammar
- be careful of the number of drafts that you go through with someone - more than 1-2 drafts you’ll both be sick of the content by that point
    - sometimes she’ll finish off the piece herself or just drop the piece at that point
    - some topics are just very knotty because they’re complex

wait for the final draft, then publish!

- shout out to the author and editors (social media links e.g.,)
- pay them and swag
    - hash out payment before the process starts

best thing? repeat authors - can solicit directed things and get them updated fairly quickly

Qs for your community if you’re thinking about adapting this model...

- how many people use your tech?
- can they write something they already know?
- can customers write?
- can support tickets become docs?
- can you ask what authors want?

if your tech is proprietary, might need different rewards
