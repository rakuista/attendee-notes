## Documentation with Human Connection

### Presented by: Hannah Gilberg


#### Ways to Improve the Human Connection
* Book: [Writing Without Teachers by Peter Elbow](http://www.powells.com/book/writing-without-teachers-9780195120165)

* Write, revise, and review  documentation to make it more engaging.


* Business Problem: created a lot of documents, but not a lot of communication because people were not reading the documents.


* Feature Overviews: Focus on the main points of the feature and why it is important, rather than technical details.


* As readers we respond to the writers voice, not the structure of the document.


* Good writing is more than adhering to rules, it is about connecting with the reader.


* If your writing is so not to be wrong, it is often too vague to benefit the reader, so the reader fills in the void themselves.
 * Be more specific, concrete, and precise in your writing.
 * Use free writing to write words and explain the topic, then review and revise.


* Summarize your writing.
 * Be more precise.
 * Why is the feature important?
 * Why do the readers care?
 * Do not get mired in detail.


* Review your writing
 * Peer review for voice of the writing.
 * Is the writing engaging or robotic?
 * Is the writer confident or uncertain?
 * Get feedback to learn what is implied rather than stated.
 * Can the reader describe what your wrote?


* Provide focus to the readers, do not confuse them with too much meta data and details.
