How to write, revise, and review docs to make them more engaging and alive

“the online help has great info but everyone still asks me for help" -- they won’t read the docs, I think it intimidates them

weren’t connecting with the customers

were creating piles of words, not communication

then pivoted to writing for video - no one had written for video before tho

tendency to go into nuts and bolts in overviews rather than talk about how the feature works and why it’s important

quality of the writing is not necessarily determined by academic authority

traditional writing techniques weren’t what determined how Elbow responded to the paper
—> rarely in awe of structure of docs, but the voice

Connecting to the reader > adhering to rules

peer review techniques:

- reading for voice
- summarizing and sayback
- movies for the mind
