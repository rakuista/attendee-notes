Tracking customer satisfaction
CSAT = customer satisfaction

how tech writers can use CSAT data to improve their documentation in cool ways

- connect directly w/ your audience
- know how useful docs are for your audience
- let users submit feedback to help your docs

Quality of customer satisfaction varies - some stuff is bad or not helpful, but good comments allow you to give the user directly what they want.

Not all of us tech writers are world-class coders, but our users are.

Super-knowledgeable audience is working with you to help you with your documentation

Doesn’t really take a lot of time to do

get a lot of comments that don’t necessarily relate to docs - but they’re the go-to resource for customers and get a view of customers using product in real-time

if docs are perfect, customers will probably go to docs to understand a product feature better (and may mention that in doc feedback)

Can you improve your docs w/o getting comments? and just using yes/no data? - yes/no votes signify how useful your doc is

UI glitch could result in something that makes the docs unhelpful

Y/N data helps you prioritize your work

What they’re doing next:

- implementing data to see more about logged-in users
- following users as they look at docs (tracking click paths)
- planning a site redesign with CSAT feedback in mind
