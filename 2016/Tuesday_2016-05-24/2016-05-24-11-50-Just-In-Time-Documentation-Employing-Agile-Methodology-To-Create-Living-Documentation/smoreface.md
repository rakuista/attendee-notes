Doc coordinator challenges

- create a living knowledge base
- shift focus from just-in-case docs to just-in-time docs

Just-in-case document - feature guide document, an article that describes a feature for a theoretical user
Write them because it’s an easy place to start and helps users learn about features

Don’t help you solve problems once you’ve bought your product

Feature guides

- require familiarity w/ terminology
- hard to search
- hard to use
- hard to produce in time for release

marketing team required “what is it, when would I use it, how would I set it up"
tasks for a user are to “is this what i’m trying to do, is this what I want, then reread to implement"

didn’t want to slow down agile processes with documentation

focus on “just in time” docs rather than “just in case"

Just in time - production strategy to cost-effectively manage inventory
don’t warehouse - wait until customers order it then make it and ship it

JIT docs - create just enough documentation just in time

What gets documented just in time?

- what the software can do + what users wish to accomplish + what users can’t figure out = just in time documentation

How to determine what users are doing and what they can’t figure out — look at support tickets

Write small articles that cover universal questions that support tickets are coming in about

Just in time in practice

- support ticket comes in
- support person responds and considers if the problem or response is generalizable (if yes, check a custom field that says “document this”)
- if yes, send to docs to write a document
- docs sends to support to review
- support may then also send doc to customers

JIT doc types/requests

- can’t find something buried in the UI
    - customizing text
    - merging page breaks back together
- “how do i…”? walkthroughs that involve lots of features and bits of the app to achieve
    - enter in-person paper survey responses
    - create a diary survey
    - create a pre-test and post-test survey
- FAQs (what the hell docs)
    - how are required questions left unanswered?
    - why can’t I see my survey changes/updates?
- workarounds (want to do something that isn’t covered by a feature)
    - send a reminder to people that started a survey but didn’t finish
    - send a text from your survey

Writing MVP docs - quick docs that answer very specific questions. no screenshots. let the users help you vet the content.

Post-writing tasks (it’s not over when you publish)

- monitor traffic
    - unpublished low-traffic docs
    - gussy up high-traffic docs
        - add screenshots, polish the writing
- let customers know
    - recent articles with dates
    - New tags so they can identify new knowledge base articles
- get and respond to feedback
    - Act fast

Some people think that documentation’s purpose is to reduce support tickets

“I never would’ve found this setting without the help article"

- it’s ok to have a lot of content
- docs can be updated just in time too
- document workarounds
- documentation is its own product

Still making data-driven decisions, but after writing content first.
