### Presented by: Brianne Hillmer [@writebriwrite](https://twitter.com/writebriwrite)


#### Just In Case (JIC) documents
* JIC defined: Feature guide, easy place to start, helps users learn about features, but doesn't solve problems for customers:
* Difficult to use or search.
* Requires familiarity with terminology.
* Cumbersome when trying to complete a task.


#### Just-In-Time (JIT) documents
* JIT defined: Manufacturing production strategy, cost effective, produce and ship products based on customer needs.
* Create documents when customers need documentation.
* Document the intersection of:
 * Software functionality.
 * What the user wants to accomplish.
 * What the users cannot figure out.


#### Learn about the User's Needs
* Two questions:
 * What do the users want to accomplish?
 * What is the user unable to figure out for themselves?
* Where to get information
 * Support tickets
 * Feedback from Technical Support and Sales Reps
 * Documentation comments
 * Search terms
 * Forums
* You do not have time to mine data and write documents. Create documents about relevant topics, common questions, or things that affect large audiences.


#### JIT Doc Types
* Buried in the UI that people cannot find.
* How do I?
 * For example: walkthroughs, require many features or locations of the application to complete a task.
* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).
* Workarounds.


#### Post Writing Tasks
* Monitor documentation traffic.
 * Remove unneeded documents.
 * Update high-use documents.
* Notify customers when documentation is in-progress or completed.
* Act fast on the feedback you receive about documents.


#### Lessons Learned
* It is OK to have a lot of content.
* Documents can be updated using JIT.
* Document workarounds.
* Documentation is its own product.


#### You can do JIT
* Create a systematic process.
* Document it fast.
* Be a JIT champion.
