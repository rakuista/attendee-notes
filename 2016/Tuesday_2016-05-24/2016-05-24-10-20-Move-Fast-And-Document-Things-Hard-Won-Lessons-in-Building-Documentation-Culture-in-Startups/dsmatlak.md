#### Internal Technical Docs - defined:
* Materials we create for colleagues and our future selves.
* Enable us to do our work.


#### How to write internal docs at fast-moving organizations in four steps:
1. Figure out what is broken.
 * Dig into the issue, solve the correct problem, analyze the issue.
 * Example: there is a belief by some engineers that internal technical documents depreciate too quick.
 * Example: Presumption of homogenous tech backgrounds and institutional knowledge
 * Anyone can fix problems with internal documents. There is no ambiguous *right* way to write internal documents. Store documents in one place and ensure that everyone uses that data as opposed to their own copies of data.
1. Figure out why your organization will care about fixing whatever is broken.
 *  What you document and how you document it are an expression of the company culture.
1. Couch your solutions in the organization's values.
1. At every inflection point, reevaluate, rinse, repeat.
 * Reevaluate your values to make sure it makes sense for the larger goal of the company.
