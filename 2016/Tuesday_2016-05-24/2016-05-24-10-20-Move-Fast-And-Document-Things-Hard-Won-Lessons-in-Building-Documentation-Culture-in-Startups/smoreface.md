Your company’s existence depends on the existence of external technical docs

- API ref
- how-to guides
- sample apps
- faqs
- developer docs
- SDKs

internal technical docs

- READMEs
- uptime docs
- setting up the VM
- wikis
- how to rotate credentials when someone leaves

internal docs = materials we create for colleagues & for future selves and enable us to build upon our work

“we care about internal technical docs because they help our software last as long as possible"
- slow-moving non-profit

codebases needed to be understandable enough to run rather than maintain or extend - the why behind code choices didn’t matter.

“we care about internal technical docs because…actually, we don’t"
- agency

business model of the agency is basically disposable plastic bag equivalents of software

“We care about internal technical docs because they help us onboard new staff"

“Why bother reading me’s” READMEs

Painful points trying to get systems working to do her job

internal docs success = commit and deploy code before lunch on your first day

How to write internal docs at fast-moving orgs in 4 simple steps

- Figure out what’s broken
    - what you think is broken might not actually be broken
    - things that weren’t broken =
        - build process best practices,
        - amazing colleagues - they always revised confusing docs
    - what was broken
        - belief that internal docs depreciate in value too fast - as soon as you write it it’s obsolete
        - presumption of homogenous tech backgrounds (know the same things about the same languages)
            - she was the first fully front-end hire
        - presumption of institutional knowledge
            - small code base meant that many had the knowledge to do their jobs w/o sharing
        - no unambiguous “right” way to write internal docs
            - where should they live?
            - doesn’t matter what place you pick just pick one
- Figure out why your organization will care about fixing it
    - bus factor - the number of people that can be lost from a project (hit by a bus) before the project collapses
    - how much institutional knowledge is locked into 1-2 people’s heads?
    - what are you working on? how do these things work together?
    - organization value - learning from each other!
    - if you have the same values you can work together as a team and move forward together
    - your engineering orgs approach to internal docs is a great way to recognize their engineering culture and company values
        - actual values, not the posters on the wall.
- Couch your solutions in the organization’s values
    - weekly show and tell of a solution! person doing the show and tell has to have spent no time with the code base prior (good check for existence and accuracy of internal docs)
- At every inflection point, reevaluate, rinse, repeat
