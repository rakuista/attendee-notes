#### Improve Communication
* Technical writers can improve communication with developers.
* Fewer meetings; most developers do not like meetings.
* Find two or three things that can help the developer improve their writing and then help them.
 * Result: fixing those two or three things might improve their writing by 80% and then they don't have to attend meetings.
 * If you can reduce the number of meetings developers need to attend, then it is easier to get developers to meet with you when you need them.


#### Learn software development
* Know that you can learn software development or other difficult subject matter.
* Expect failure. Set up a limited scope for yourself to *not understand* a subject.
 * When you fail, try a different method to learn the subject matter.


#### Learn how to code
* Find a method that works for you, might need to try several learning methods.
* Expect failures, so use courses that are inexpensive, free, or have monthly memberships:
 * Community College courses
 * YouTube videos
 * [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
 * [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)
 * [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/)
* Bootcamps are expensive, but are a great way to learn how to code and helps with interviews.
* Freebie for the self-motivated: learnhowtoprogram.com
