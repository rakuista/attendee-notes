Effectiveness only has meaning with a goal in mind (like more time, money, or influence)

Goal of tech writing - explain complex information in a clear way

Hard to use products? Go read the manual or take some training…but that’s not a solution anymore. They care about using tools that empower them to do amazing work, not actually reading the docs.

Goal of a tech writer is to help build products that need no documentation

- Be the CEO of the docs
    - define a vision
        - provide hints to users in the product (so they can do their task w/o reading the docs) aka MICROCOPY
        - write contextual help in the product (should be able to get help w/o leaving the app)
        - Define what and where to document. Create a minimum amount of docs to get your users going.
    - pitch your vision to developers, designers, support, and PM. you’re not making arbitrary decisions!
    - drive the vision
        - implement it, make sure your focus is clear
        - schedule time to do strategic work
    - ensure others follow your vision
- know the market, product, and users
    - understanding the pain points allows you to write documentation that helps the users instead of getting in the way
    - don’t need to document things you can understand by looking at the UI — no one will read it
    - if you don’t know the real pain points, hard to prioritize work, pitch your vision and create docs that get in the way
- Ask why
    - PM asks for something, support asks for something, devs ask for something
    - Ask why - find out the problem people are trying to solve
    - Backlog goes up, hard to prioritize your work with lots of different asks
    - Can’t share your roadmap with others because you’re busy managing work from others
    - No time for strategic work because you’re busy following other people’s asks
- Apply the 80/20 rule
    - Perfection takes time.
    - if you don’t apply 80/20 rule, you work a lot but don’t have a real impact on your user’s life
    - fix a lot of things that seem urgent but really aren’t.
    - lots of stress
- be proactive
    - don’t give excuses
        - management won’t let me
        - everyone ignores me
        - competition has more resources
    - people in your company may think you complain a lot but ship nothing
    - have lots of unproductive discussions that lead nowhere
- treat words as tools
    - understand the limitations of the words you use and complement them with other things
    - or you can change the language itself if it isn’t working for you
    - words let you transfer ideas but they kind of suck at their jobs
    - complement with diagrams, screenshots, code samples, videos
    - if you’re only obsessed with style guides,
        - you might be doing art not technical documentation
        - working on tactical projects like rearranging sentences
- coach others
    - instead of asking developers to make a ticket for a problem they found, ask devs to fix it themselves and help them. Sometimes the time it takes to file a ticket is the same amount of time it takes to fix a problem.
    - coach them with presentations, style guides, blog posts, and 1:1 sessions
    - if you keep your knowledge to yourself, you’re fighting against the world, you’re a bottleneck and people don’t understand what you do.
