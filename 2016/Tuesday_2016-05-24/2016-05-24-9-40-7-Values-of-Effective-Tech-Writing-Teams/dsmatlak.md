#### The goal of a technical writer:
* Help build products that need no documentation.


#### Seven Values
1. Be the CEO of documentation.
  * Define a vision.
  * Create microcopy so users can continue their task without reading a document.
  * Use in-app help.
  * Define which features to document and where to share information with users.
  * Define what not to document.
  * Define how to organize Information.
1. Pitch your vision.
  * Tell people that you have a vision and explain your vision for documentation.
  * Drive your vision; make it happen.
  * Ensure others follow your vision; remind people of the vision.
1. Understand the market, product, and users.
  * Knowing the audience isn't enough.
  * If you do not understand your users, then you are creating something for yourself.
1. Ask why?
  * Effective technical writers **ask why** something needs to be documented.
  * Ask why to learn more about the problem that people are trying to solve.
  * If you don't ask why:
    * Cannot prioritize.
    * Cannot share your roadmap or vision.
    * No time for strategic work.
1. Be Proactive.
  * Implement your vision.
  * Do not make excuses such as the following; just do it.
    * Management will not let me.
    * Competition has more resources.
    * Not my job.
    * Everyone ignores my opinion.
1. Treat words as tools.
  * Developers: programming languages are tools to build software.
  * Technical Writers: English or any natural language is a tool to transfer ideas to other people.
  * Writers can change English (or any natural language).
  * Obsession with style guides, grammar rules might be art rather than writing.
1. Coach others.
  * Help others to create documentation or improve the documentation.
  * Share your knowledge as a technical writer.

**Be comfortable to create the minimal amount of documentation, ship it, and iterate as needed.**
