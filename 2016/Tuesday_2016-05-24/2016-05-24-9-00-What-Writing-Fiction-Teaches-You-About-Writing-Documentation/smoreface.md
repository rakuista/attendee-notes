elmore leonard’s 10 rules of writing

then, revised by her

Documentation is no place for a plot twist

Don’t consider just one point of view when you’re writing (but write from just one)

The interactions that other people have with your code or your product can lead to things that you don’t expect

Don’t need to remove our opinions or experiences, just pay attention to them.

Pay attention to opinion clue words, transition words (of course, besides, furthermore, obviously)

Write like Hemingway, not Dickens (who was paid by the word). Hemingway app is a thing: http://www.hemingwayapp.com/

Emotion matters.

Second mention of clever ≠ clarity this conference

Provide context - can use a glossary or a timeline for context for fiction

- link EVERYWHERE to help with context.

Other reading orders may address use cases you haven't thought of yet. so it helps to follow EPPO (every page is page one) - there doesn’t have to be (and shouldn’t have to be) one place you MUST start.

encourage fan fiction! aka community input and writing docs. Involve the community - create integrations, write tutorials, etc.
fandoms with the best communities have tools that let them keep contributing.

use beta readers and workshops
