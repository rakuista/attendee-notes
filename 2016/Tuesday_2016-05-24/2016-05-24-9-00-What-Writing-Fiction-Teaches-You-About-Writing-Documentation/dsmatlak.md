## What Writing Fiction Teaches You About Writing Documentation

### Presented by: Thursday Bram [@thursdayb](https://twitter.com/thursdayb)


#### Notable Comments from the Presenter
* We can bring elements of fiction writing to documentation and improve the documentation.
* Documentation is no place for a plot twist.
 * Do not surprise your reader with an unexpected result or concept.
* Emulate Hemingway in his writing style, not drinking habits.
* Conclusions are important in documentation to confirm that the task is completed.


#### Kill your darlings
* Clever is rarely clear; clarity is crucial to the reader.


#### Provide Context
* Providing context is critical; use links to direct the reader to more details.
* Reading order is part of context, set a reading order:
  * Recommend a reading order.
  * Encourage feedback from the community about the reading order.


#### Use beta readers and workshops
* Collaborative process.
* Pre-release your documents to get community feedback.


#### Reading and Writing are connected habits
* Read as widely as possible; read things that have nothing to do with documentation or software.
* Being widely read will help you find inspiration, metaphors, or perspectives.
* Write everyday and read intensely: take notes - Ray Bradbury
