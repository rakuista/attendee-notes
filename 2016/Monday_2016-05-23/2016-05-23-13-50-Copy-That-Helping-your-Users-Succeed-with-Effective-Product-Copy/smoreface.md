This talk was super interesting and packed a lot of information into the time.

Product and application copy
content strategy - inform, inspire, and empower users through elegant and scalable content
application copy? 
* any text element in your UI that you write and your users read
  * feature names, subtitles, field names, button text, confirmations, error messages

Product copy is documentation for people who don’t read documentation

* helps you identify inconsistencies in your products workflow
* when everyone uses the same words to mean the same things everyone understands each other better
* product copy is pretty different from tech documentation
  * have to make assumptions, multiple use cases, and be comprehensive in documentation. Not so in product copy.

- best practices
- workflow management (involves some interaction design)
- scaling, internationalization, and working cross-functionally

best practices

- product full of features, not documented with any sort of rigor... what will you call your next feature? what will the button say?
- your product copy needs to be sorted. every string in your product should have a predetermined purpose.
- everything should answer 3 questions
    - what does this do?
        - feature names, menu items
    - how do I use it?
        - placeholder text, links, buttons (if they click on something, this text)
    - why should I care?
        - explanations for sponsored content, e.g.
- writing is easier when you have a system
    - you don’t have to reinvent a UI copy plan every time a feature ships
    - when scaling happens, can’t spend as much time on individual features
    - that also helps other people do writing when you’re not around
- start writing
    - product copy is heavily contextual
        - frequently time-sensitive
        - use-case specific
        - keep users engaged and curious on what comes next
        - “a friend is typing a comment” vs “someone is typing a comment” - one is more engaging
        - “save as new profile, saves the changes to the selected profile as a new profile” tooltip is supposed to tell you what happens. Tooltip isn’t contextual enough, gives you too much information but not enough to know what’s going next
    - HELP YOUR USERS MAKE CHOICES
        - verbs tell your users what they’re about to do
        - start buttons with verbs
    - Speak to the user’s experience, not the use case
        - Get vs Free when downloading an app from iPhone app store
        - user’s experience is more important than your company’s business drivers
    - Speak the user’s language
        - Say DOWNLOAD not REQUEST APP FROM SERVER
        - Don’t talk about what the code is doing, talk about what the user is doing.
    - Check urban dictionary to make sure jargon or colloquial language means only what you think it means.

workflow management

- product copy is the best way to guide your users
    - the art of giving precise instructions, have to know exactly what is going on in the workflow
    - what info do they need and when do they need it?
    - some apps wait for you to fail before telling you password restrictions, IFTTT puts it in the field
- unobtrusive help lets experienced users ignore what they already know, but helps users that don’t.
- button text can change in response to the next step in your workflow
    - dynamic button text is a great way to illustrate changes in backend states when your real estate is limited

scaling

- scaling CMS is different from scaling product copy
- never too early to start thinking about how your product copy strategy evolves as the product scales
- if you don’t do it, you set yourself up for heinous content and technical debt
- how do you work cross-functionally as teams scale?
    - content strategy isn’t very siloed—touches marketing and support and engineering etc.
    - can’t write copy in a vacuum so you need to develop comm skills that work well w/ everyone
- Processes should be
    - transparent (documented somewhere)
    - accountable (sit down in a room with stakeholders and agree on it)
    - measurable (success criteria are clearly defined)
- Team roles
    - design = flexibility in UI layouts (like modals with room for helpful text)
    - PM = business cases for features and workflows
    - customer service and support - insight into customer pain points
- localization
    - internationalization is terrifying, very expensive, and hard to do well
    - important to consider jargon in localized language. very easily to slip into regionalized jargon. doesn’t translate.
    - can minimize the number of strings that you need to translate.
    - pull all the variables out of the lines of content

- sort your copy elements
- write to the user, not company or engineer
- choose your words carefully
- manage workflows w/ copy
- educate w/o disrupting the user
- plan to scale early
