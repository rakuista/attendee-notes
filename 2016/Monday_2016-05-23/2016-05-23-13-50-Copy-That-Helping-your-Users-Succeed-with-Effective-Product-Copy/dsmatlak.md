### Presented by: Sarah Day [@scribblingfox](https://twitter.com/scribblingfox)


#### Best Practices
* Every text element in the UI should have a predetermined purpose.
* Writing is easier when you have a system.
* Product copy is heavily contextual (be specific).
* Help your users make choices.
* Button content should begin with verbs (rate, get, click).


#### The user experience is more important than the company's business drivers.
* Know your audience, do not assume knowledge.
* Use terms that explain the user's experience, for example: *download the application*.


#### Verify the Words
* Use the [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) to verify colloquialisms or slang.
* Be careful not to use words that have *other* meanings or do not translate between cultures.


#### Workflow management
* User's experience should feel seamless.
* Great example: include rules in a text entry box, such as password field that contains: *minimum of 6 characters*.
* Use dynamic button text that changes if the user changes their workflow.
 * *Finish* button changes to *Continue* if the user decides to change from a basic configuration and use more advanced options. For example, setting up a GitHub account.


#### Processes that are developed cross-functionally should be:
* Transparent
* Accountable
* Measurable


#### Internationalizing best practices
* Do not use jargon or regionalized dialect.
* Translation is expensive.
* Use less words, be concise.


#### Notable Comments from the Presenter
* **Product copy is documentation... for people who don't read documentation.**
* Scale you content strategy. Content strategy is not a silo because it touches most teams within a company.
