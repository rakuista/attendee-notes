#### What is this thing?

#### Where are we as a community?
* The community is growing.
* How many documentarians attended Write The Docs?
 * 400 people in Portland

#### Documentarian
* Is Documentarian the right word to describe the community of people who care about documentation?
* There are mixed opinions about this term, but for now we're going to use *Documentarian*.
* Expand and evangelize documentation to other groups so that they learn to care about documentation.
 * Attend other conferences.
 * Collaborate with other meetup groups.
 * Communicate with other groups to who care about documentation.
 * Work with other groups to teach why docs are important.


#### Who are we?
* Job role demographics at Write The Docs 2016 (approximate):
 * 60% tech writers
 * 15% software developers
 * 10% tech support and designers
 * Other: librarians, content strategists, and many other important roles.


#### The future of Write The Docs NA:
* There is a possibility that the conference will need to split to West Coast and East Coast conferences because there are so many attendees.
* The goal is to remain at a local, cool venue such as the Crystal Ballroom rather than going to a huge convention hall.


#### What is Write The Docs?
* There will be a survey at end of the 2016 Portland conference.
* How do we maintain the culture as we grow?
