* We, as documentarians and humans, are designers of our own experience. Design is based on choices.

* Zen is a combination of mind and intuition working together. Similar to mindfulness or consciousness

* No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created the problem.

* Meta-problem = problem of problems

* Continuous Annoyment: state of mind filled with many small problems that add-up to a bigger problem.

* Balance problems with solutions. Looking at too many problems and too many opposing forces at once, led to simplifying things. Zen is simplicity.

* When the mind is weak, the situation becomes a problem. Evolved zen thinking to think of a *problem* as a *challenge*. Balance the challenges to find solutions.

* Create > Plan > Execute

* Fix individual problems to keep projects moving forward, focus on one challenge at a time.

* Evolution is about opportunities and continuous development.

* When the mind is strong, the situation becomes an opportunity.

* Problem > Challenge > Opportunity

* Go with the flow. Know where you and your team want to go.

* **Trust yourself and put your energy into it.**
