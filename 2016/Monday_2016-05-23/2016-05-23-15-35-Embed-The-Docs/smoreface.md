Drupal is really valuable for documentation because you can bring all your documentation from disparate components

Docs need to address the erosion of end-user attention
Centralized documentation is no longer sufficient — plays an important role
The closer your documentation is to the product, the less catch-up you have to play.
Documentation is more important as a sales artifact today. Part of your sales cycle happens before people contact you.

Docs ≠ manuals, there are other paradigms in use today

1. Contextual text snippets - microcopy. https://air.mozilla.org/before-the-docs-writing-for-user-interfaces/
2. Hover over tooltips - have to be useful and intentional
3. Walkthroughs or guided tours (http://pronovix.com/walkhub)
4. Help centers - get help icons that open “more information” or a support chat or other patterns. Contextual help! (http://embedthedocs.com/)

Use tools like Acquit Lift to change microcopy or embed based on people’s audience or who they are.
Could tune the interface to the person sitting in front of it.
