### Presented by: Britta Gustafson [@brittagus](https://twitter.com/brittagus)


#### Three Main Points:
* Federal government is doing interesting things with digital services.
* Tech writing skills are important.
* Public service + open source + documentation = of the people, by the people, for the people.


#### How the Feds work:
* No swag, stickers, or t-shirts.
* My bosses, bosses, bosses boss is a document: The Constitution of the United States.


#### Government Employees
* Many **18F** employees are not career government employees, but their goal is to work to make the government work better:
 * Raise the Bar
 * Empower people to improve procurement
 * Teach people
 * build platforms
 * Recruit people


#### Working at **18F**:
* Made improvements to share info between government agencies.
* Create documents or blog posts to promote the services you've created.
* People should be able to see what the government has spent taxpayer money.
* You should be able to read the code and propose changes (non-sensitive info).
* You should be able to reuse and adapt the work the public paid for because it belongs to the citizens of the USA.
