Britta Gustafson, 18F, @brittagus

- The government is doing cool stuff w/ digital services (open APIs and open data, helping you file your taxes, transforming payroll to be free)
- Tech writing skills are important for the gov in surprising and rewarding ways
- public service + open source + documentation = of the people, by the people, for the people

Government doesn’t generally print promo stickers with taxpayer money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

My boss's boss's boss's boss is a document

GSA provides services to the other agencies in the government (you need a building, GSA rents it to you)

18F helps agencies build and buy digital services

Agencies can hire private companies, their own devs, or 18F to do work

Advantages of working with 18F
- human-centered design
- agile/iterative way —> tend to be fulfilling smaller contracts than traditionally
- open source (FOSS) —> all software they build
- and they’re feds —> goals are the same as the agency, want the government to work better, save money, and work fine

Most of them have 2-4 year appointments, about 180 people in 18F

They do RFP ghostwriting

Other orgs doing good stuff in the government too
* USDS is part of the white house and works on president things — got started because of healthcare.gov
* CFPB (consumer financial protection bureau)
* (not included in her talk but I <3 what the FTC has been doing as well in terms of content & comms)

Government websites have lots of words.

Britta is on the Content Design team - generalist writer role, and they each fulfill different roles of expertise

Working on eRegulations project...
- CPFB wanted to make it easier for customers of banking institutions to understand regulations
- the ATF wants people to read their regulations about how to safely store explosives

Also need to hand things back to the agencies they build these things for, so they write documentation about the project and how to work with the software that they build

Writing the content for the site but also documenting the backend of the site itself

Everything that works for technical writing works for these weird intersections

Had to understand and evaluate the source code policy, and submitted comments (effectively bug reports) on the policy language

Bringing the capability of commenting on government work (regulations, policies, laws, actions, local work) to government software (like healthcare.gov)

All of the data is public with regard to how the government spends its money, and the DATA act is trying to make that easier

Copyright does not apply to US government works - you should be able to reuse and adapt the work the public paid for, because it belongs to you (as a taxpayer)

If all federal employees thought of themselves as a part of FOSS, that would be WHOAAAA COOOOOL

Work that contractors do for the federal government is not under the public domain

Of course, it’s hard to read or contribute to or reuse code that isn’t well-documented

What if more people felt like participants in their government? They could fix that typo on the website that they use? += huge tons of skilled people wanted to work for or contract for government

The government is a big machine for buying things

want to get involved? Besides, 18F, also check out the US Digital Service & Presidential Innovation Fellows

eRegulations site needs some work if we want to contribute ^-^
