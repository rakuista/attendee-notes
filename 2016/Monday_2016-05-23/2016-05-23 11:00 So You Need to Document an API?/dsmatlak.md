## So You Need to Document an API?

#### What is an API?
* An API is a set of requirements that govern how one application communicates with another application.
* API documents are all about answering questions.

#### RESTful API
* REST is the architectural style; rules or constraints.
* Most REST APIs are actually RESTful
* RESTful uses elements of REST
* communicates over HTTP.
* Uses the HTTP verbs such as: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

#### Three types of documentation
* Conceptual: how a product or service works.
* Tutorial: step-by-step guide.
* Reference: all the details of the product or service.


#### Take stock in the doc
* Who are your users? (know your audience)
* What are your users motivations?
* What do people want to do with your API?
* Which programming languages are popular among your users?


#### What does the API do?
* What does the API let people do? Why did you create the API?
* How does this API relate to your other APIs?
* Access, Auth mechanisms, credentials?


#### Where do tech writers come in?
* What is your role and your responsibilities? What are the API developers responsibilities?
* Who writes the code? Do you need code samples in multiple programming languages?
* How will you handle versioning? How you version affects tools and design decisions.
* Who is going to review what you write? The Support Team are good reviewers!


#### Concepts to cover
* API call pattern.
* Common [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) parameters.
* Asset descriptions and how they interact.
* Words and what they mean. Remove ambiguous terms, write for the audience.


#### Tools to document an API
* **Sphinx**: build HTML, PDF, and ePUB from one source.
* **Slate**: [Stripe-style API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) reference output, Markdown backbone.


#### If you must use MadCap Flare
* One page per endpoint.
* Use table snippets for parameters and responses + conditions for whether they appear.
* Figure out the syntax highlighting for code blocks.
