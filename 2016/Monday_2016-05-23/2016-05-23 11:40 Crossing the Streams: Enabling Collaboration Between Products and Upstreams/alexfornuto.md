@shaunm

Note: I was away for too much of this talk, merge with @ryangyoung's notes


Thinking in Topics

 - Write only what's necessary
 - Be upfront about required background
 - Cross-link to other topics
 - Do not expect a linear reading
 - Every page is page one.


## Every Page is Page One

**When a user lands on some page in documentation, you have to assume that it's the first page of your documentation they've seen.**

## How product teams can Upstream

 - Community is a good source of piecemeal content
   - Can be a braindump, without content strategy
 - Help organize and Curate content
 - Help form content strategy plan
 - Connect writers to SMEs.


## Content Strategy In A Box

Audience Analysis

 - Split your audience into 3-5 segments
   - Segments should cover every reader
 - In eahc segment, define 3-5 samples
   - Talk about specific needs & circumstances
   - Samples can't possibly cover every reader.

Assemble Bottom-UP

 - Create Topics from User Stories
 - Do Card Sorts and other Exercises to put topics in categories
 - categories, not linear narrative
 - you will always need to add more topics to your user stories
 - remember that topics will be reassembled downstream
