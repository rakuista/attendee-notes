#### Red Hat
* Red Hat: everything is open source.
* Red Hat motto: upstream first.
* Make upstream open source documents great.
* Make upstream docs reusable by downstream users.


#### Think in topics
* Every page is page one.
* Do not assume the reader has read your document in order.
* Use links for your information.
* Use tasks to explain how to accomplish a goal
* Connect writers to samples.


#### Working with community
* Involve your community in everything.
* Do not treat the community as unpaid workers.
* Do not do upstream work in secret, be transparent.


#### Audience analysis
* Split your audience into 3-5 segments that includes all of your readers.
* In each segment, define 3-5 samples:
  * Talk about specific needs and circumstances.
  * Samples will not be able to include every reader.


#### User stories are to do at Doc Sprints
For example:

```
As a ________, I want to ________, so I can ________.
```
