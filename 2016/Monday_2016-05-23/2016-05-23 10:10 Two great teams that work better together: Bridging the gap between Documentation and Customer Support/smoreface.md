Once upon a time when software came in boxes…the documentation team was in Menlo Park but customer support was in Dublin. Tech writing team didn’t know them, never talked to them, just knew that they existed. 
In the manuals, “send comments/questions/suggestions to <email address>” 

Customer comments was going into some file somewhere in a database, and therefore forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind. 

Documentation and Customer Support are often not talking to each other

Ticket deflection? More like ticket direction. Don’t want our customers to go away - we want to hear what they’re asking, what problems they’re having, we want the docs to answer their Qs but not be the end of the conversation. 
Customer feedback = happy customers = buy more, renew, and say nice things about your product

Why aren’t customer support and documentation sharing more information with each other? 
* Documentation is prescriptive (how the product should be used)
* Support is descriptive (how the product is really used)
Customer isn’t sure where to go in that kind of circumstance too. Don’t put the burden of the decision on your customer.

When they don’t work together, you get redundant effort. More work of lower quality (than it should or could be)
If you don’t know how customers are using the product, you’re writing them based on instinct or opinion, not data. 

that = frustrated customers, frustrated customer support 

What to do:

1. meet your support team
  1. build a relationship with them
  2. who are they? do they specialize in certain areas?
  3. you want to work with their manager to make knowledge capture and sharing part of the support team’s goals
2. review support tickets
  1. if possible.
  2. “I’ve read the documentation but I still don’t understand…..” and that’s really helpful to get customer use cases
  3. review difficult and interesting cases
3. Set up automated processes (on the support side)
  1. allow them to select a component or set tags of documentation that routes to the doc team (this was mentioned in a later talk too, about just in time docs)
4. Learn about your customers
  1. levels of expertise? skill level? where are they in the learning process
  2. see what vocabulary your customers are using - how do they talk about your product - if it doesn’t match your terminology, maybe you need to change and meet them
5. review ticket metrics - documentation tickets
  1. get a baseline for how many tickets your support team sees on various types
  2. work with support on creating these reports
6. Join forces
  1. Mine things from customer support knowledge bases
  2. Don’t make your customers go to multiple places
  3. Make it clear to your customers where the answers are
7. Have support write
  1. Document cool solutions they find, customer use cases, etc.
  2. Don’t underestimate them because they communicate with customers every day
  3. Give them credit - let them know that and where you’ve used their information
  4. That makes them more willing to help you and give you more information
8. Don’t train, template
  1. provide the support team with templates to help them contribute
  2. this helps them overcome their fear of the blank page
9. Bring them in
  1. Value partners
  2. have them review your documentation
  3. they know the product and the customers perhaps better than you do
10. Keep reviewing ticket metrics and look for change
  1. do the number and type of documentation and question metrics change over time? 
  2. type of tickets changes; shifts to more complex issues
11. Knock down silos!
  1. customers don’t care about your company structure <-- THIS TIMES A MILLION
  2. you don’t want to have to go break into every silo and pull out every nugget of information
  3. You want information coming to you
12. Share knowledge
  1. build a culture of information sharing - you don’t want to play detective every day - you want information flowing to you
