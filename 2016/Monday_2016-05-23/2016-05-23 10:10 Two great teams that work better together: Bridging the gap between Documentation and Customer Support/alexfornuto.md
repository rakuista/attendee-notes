Bridging the gap between documentation and customer support.

## Once upon a time

When Software came in boxes, documentation team in Menlo Park, worked with engineers, project managers, Support was....... In Dublin

Asking around for files from support, talk to someone to talk to Tom.... So support bugs were forgotten

## Why should I care

"Documentation is self-service customer support"

AKA Ticket Deflection? Not quite, more like ticket direction.  "You don't tell the customers 'rtfm goodnight'."

good docs = happy customers = more $$$

## Another Story

At a meet up, two presenters - Support and Documentation

Support said "we have a KB"

Docs said "we have a help site"

both had hundreds of documents

Raised his hand and asked "Same tools, sharing content"

NOPE!

Asked **"Why?"**


"Because Documentation is prescriptive (how it should be use)
 support is descriptive (how it's *really* used)"


Result = Redundant effort - more work of lower quality

Data > opinion

Docs by instinct, not data - not the way to do it. Leads to customer frustration, frustrated customer support.

## What do I do?

 - Meet your support team
 - Build a relationship. You want to know who they are, and want them to know who you are. Who are your SME?
 - Work with management, make subject matter capturing a goal of their team
 - Review support tickets, look for questions starting with "how do I...", "I want to do...", "I've looked at the documentation, but..."
 - Set up automated processes - Docs ticket tag, category, etc.
 - Review difficult and interesting cases - diagram hard problems for yourself, to turn into docs
 - Learn about your cusotmers, their level of expertise.
 - What vocablary is the customer using to talk about the product? If it doesn't match yours, maybe you need to change...
 - Review ticket metrics.
 - Join forces - mine support's KB, consolidate to "one source of truth"
 - Have support write docs - show them where it is, how it's used, how valuable it is.
 - Don't train, template! Instead of a long overdrawn style guide, provide a template to fill in. Overcome fear of the blank page.
 - Close the loop, bring them in to the process.
 - **Keep** reviewing ticket metrics - there may not be fewer documentation issues over time, just a change in the subject / topic / level
 - Knock down Silos! AKA Share Knowledge. Start with support, but expand. You want support coming to you with interesting use cases and solutions, or ideas for docs you don't yet have.
 - Reprioritize tasks.

## Docs + Support = Awesome
