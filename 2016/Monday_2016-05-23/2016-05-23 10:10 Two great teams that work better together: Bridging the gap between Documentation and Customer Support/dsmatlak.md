#### Customers
* Happy customers = More sales. And, a happy customer will:
 * Renew subscriptions.
 * Buy Products.
 * Provide feedback.


#### Where to find data and information for documentation:
* Review support tickets.
* Review the difficult and interesting support tickets and cases.
* Learn about your customers and their levels of expertise.
* Read support tickets and match your terminology to the customer's terminology.
* Review ticket metrics for trends.


#### Tech writers and the support team should join forces:
* Mine the support database.
* Do not make customers go to different places for information.
* Encourage the support team to write documentation.
* Do not underestimate support team. They work with customers everyday.
* Give credit to the support team for writing documents.
* Do not give support team a 200 page style guide and then tell them not to write documentation until they have read it.
* Build templates, do not make the support team start from a blank page. Templates helps people start writing, improves document consistency, and makes it easier for the technical writer to edit and publish.
* Get support to review documents that technical writers create. Get their feedback because they are the subject matter expert (SME).
* Continue to review document metrics and look for changes.


#### Notable Comments from the Presenter
* Documentation is self-service technical support and we want the users to find the answers to their questions.
* If teams don't share information you get redundant information of varying quality.
 * **Knock Down Silos!**
 * **Share knowledge!**
* **Docs + Support = Awesome**
