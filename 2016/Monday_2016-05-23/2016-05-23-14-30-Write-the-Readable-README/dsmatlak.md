## Write the Readable README

### Presented by: Daniel Beck [@ddbeck](https://twitter.com/ddbeck)

#### Context of a README file
* What kind of project is this?
* What other files accompany this README?
 * licenses, authors, contributors
* Which markup is this?
 *  how was the README composed: Markdown, Restructured text, or plain text.


#### Content of a README
* Which topics does the file include?
 * For example: Python library
* Which links are in the file?
 * other items author thought was important or information reader needs to know
* Which images are in the file?
 * animated GIFs, logos, pictures, visual impressions


#### Subjective
* What was good about the README?
 * effective, informational
* What was bad?
 * unsuccessful or not helpful
* How did the README make me feel?
 * what effect did the README have on me


#### The Bad News
* README quality varies.
 * openly hostile to the reader.
* There are few conventions.
* READMEs are missing information.
 * 17% do not want you to know the project's name.
 * 31% do not want tyou to know what the project is.
 * 46% don't want you to know where the project is.


#### The Good News
* README quality varies.
 * You can learn a lot from READMEs.
 * Even average READMEs contained clever solutions to problems.
* There are few conventions.
 * No need to worry about breaking reader expectations.
* READMEs are missing information.
 * Comprehensive READMEs are equivalent to short, perfunctory READMEs.
 * When READMEs answer all the questions or answer none of the questions, the situation is similar because the reader cannot find what they are looking for.


#### README Renaissance
* READMEs are special documents, located in the top-level of the directory structure.
* All caps: README
* Dont need special tools, plain text is fine.
* GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab are elevating the README to make it more prominent and visible.
 * Make the README look good using Restructured Text, converted to HTML with nice topography so that people want to read the README.
* A link to a good README informs the reader about the project or where the project is stored.


#### Typical README
* Markdown file.
* Jargon-filled project description.
* Random list of:
 * Feature lists.
 * Installation instructions.
 * Configuration and settings.
 * Dependencies.
 * Example usage.
 * Social media links.
 * Authors, sponsorship, patents.
 * Copyright, badges


#### The best READMEs give you confidence about the project even if the README does not answer all your questions.


#### READMEs that build the readers confidence accomplish four things:
1. Help the reader identify the project.
 * project name, who created it, why does it exist.
1. Evaluate the project.
 * Who is this for? Who does the project help? Where did it come from?
1. Use the project (once)
 * Provs that the project works.
1. Help the reader engage with the project
 *  direct user's to documentation, contributing, user and developer communities


#### Templates and style guides are available for README files. But take caution using templates:
* Templates imply that your work is not finished until you complete each blank.
* Every blank is a question, but you might not need to answer each question.
* The order of the template might not be the order in which you write the README.

#### Review your project's README
* Identify
* Evaluate
* Use
* Engage
* Six months later, review the README and ask yourself if you are confident with the README?


#### Mad Libs
* Reject being clever when writing a README. Be more robotic, such as Mad Libs.
* Mad Lib examples:
```
With <project> you can <verb> <noun>...
<project helps you <verb> <noun>...
Unlike <alternative>, <project> <verbs> <noun>...
```
