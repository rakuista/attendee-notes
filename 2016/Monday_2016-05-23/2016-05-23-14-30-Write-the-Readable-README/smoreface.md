CONFIDENCE

a README to give you confidence

In order to assess the quality of READMEs, he made a list of readme files that he wanted to read, including every readme on github with 10K> stars

Context

- what kind of project is it?
    - some repositories are just README files
    - github gives you stats about the programming language distributions of the files
- what other files accompany this README?
    - contributors, containers
- what markup is it?
    - markdown? plaintext?

Content

- what topics does the file cover?
- what links does the file have?
    - what other things did the author link to as important references
- what images does the file have?
    - logos? badges? screenshots? gifs?
    - what visual impression did the README try to make?

Subjective

- what was good?
- what was bad?
- how did the README make me feel?

BAD NEWS

- README quality varies
    - some were almost openly hostile to the reader
- There are few conventions
    - little agreement about what is important to have in a README
- READMEs are missing information

17% of READMEs don’t want you to know the project’s name… some had them in the images, but that doesn’t count for accessibility.

31% of READMEs made no attempt to describe the project

46% of READMEs don’t want you to know where the project is

we look to the READMEs to share information about projects

Don’t need special tools to read READMEs (just a plain text editor or CLI)

Github and Bitbucket are elevating READMEs and make it the one they show you first.

good READMEs help the reader do 4 things

- Identify the project
- Evaluate the project
    - who is it for? who does it help?
- Use the project (at least once)
- Engage with the project
