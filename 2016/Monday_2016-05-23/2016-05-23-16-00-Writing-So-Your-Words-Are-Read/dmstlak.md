#### Better documentation equals:
* More users.
* Fewer support requests.
* More contributors.


#### How to writer better docs:
* Your readers are not you. Write for their experience, not yours.
* Do not write like a machine. Use friendly, easy to understand vocabulary.
* Avoid cultural references because they do not translate.
* Create a persona and write for that person.
* Remember that terms that seem obvious might not be obvious to you. Explain them.
* Use links for anything you do not want to explain. If the author does not use a link, it might be a negative for the reader because they will feel like they are supposed to understand that term or concept.
* Simplify your content whenever possible.
* Get your reader to a success moment as quick as possible.
* Use gender-neutral language.
* Cut down your content: two or three sentences per paragraph. Or, use bullets, italics, bolding to breakup content, make it easy to read or scan to document.
* Simplify your language: simple, concise vocabulary, do not make people have to translate your content to use the content.
* Do not forget to use headlines: short, easy, simplified headlines that benefit the reader.
* Use markup or code highlighting for code snippets. Code should look different than content.
* Add filenames to code blocks if it makes sense.
* Include pictures or diagrams in your document whenever possible.

**Remember that your readers have different backgrounds and experiences than you.**
