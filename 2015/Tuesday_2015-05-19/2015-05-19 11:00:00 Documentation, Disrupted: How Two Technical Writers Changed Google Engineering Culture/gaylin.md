Documentation Disrupted: Riona MacNamara (Google)

TED Talk to view: The happy secret to better work.

Happiness inspires productivity. Predictors:

- optimism (the certainty that you will make a difference)

  Top down doesn't work, but bottom up doesn't scale.

- perception of stress (do you see it as a threat or a challenge)

- connection (support, collaboration, and influence all matter)

  There's a culture of scarcity around access to engineering and especially engineering leadership.

For an internal engineering ecosystem they had to design for engineers, not writers (or marketers). They had no time, no incentive, and no culture for docs.

Documentation will never be part of engineering culture until it is integrated into the codebase and the engineering workflow.

Governance belongs to the contributors.

Once engineers had a seat at the table, face time with engineering increased radically and doc teams came to meetings as peers.

Things they know are true:

- focus on the engineer (take off your writing hat)
- momentun matters (start small, iterate often, have it rock solid)
- authority and influence don't come from your resume but from action and impact
