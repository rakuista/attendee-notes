Github: Garen Torikian

Workflow at Github is the focus of this talk. But they're hoping it's a talk about our workflow too.

Their workflow is always evolving and will continue to do so.

1. Write simply.

  - Use a five cent word instead of the 5 dollar word.
  - Keep it to one idea on a page.
  - Speak like a human.

Doc accuracy shifts to the review process at Github.

Pull requests are the discussions at Github. They discuss as much as possible and do it publicly in the PR instead of email. Email is a terrible place from whence nothing escapes.

Even new employees won't have access to old emails but they will have access to PRs because they have linkable URLs.

Never underestimate the power of unsubscribing from Github notifications.

Nothing can do ten things well except maybe a swiss army knife. KEEP IT SIMPLE.

Everyone can build. The barrier to entry is lower when they use Github at the company.
