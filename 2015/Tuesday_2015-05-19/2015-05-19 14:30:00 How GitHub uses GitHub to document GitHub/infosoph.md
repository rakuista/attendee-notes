- workflow
    - the result of many mistakes
- quality code and quality docs are often separate processes
- help.github.com is our second most-visited site

write
-----

- write simply 
- simply write 
- markdown
    - structure is a bit loose

Review
------

- accuracy shifts to review process
- use pull request for reviews
    - the real power of pull requests is discussing changes
    - less email, more pull requests
    - teach by doing
        - demonstrate how we communicate and make decisions
    - discuss and improve
    - urls last longer
    - ping people directly
    - @mention teams instead
    - people can unsubscribe if they want

Build
-----

- build docs like it's 1999
- jekyll: do one thing, do it well 
    - write text
    - build html
    - everyone can build
    - test content
        - broken links, images
        - templates working
        - html-proofer
        - capybar/selenium
        - github commit status api
    - jekyll auth (limit access)
    - github deploy
- publish
    - you merge, it deploys
- measure
    - "those who cannot measure the past are condemned to repeat it" -- santayana
    - measure all of it 
    - numbers into pictures
    - what's the sound of well written documentation that noone can find?
