<p>Everyone knows that GitHub is the place to host your project&#39;s code. What you may not know is that the same workflow developers use to create, update, and manage their software is also used to create, update, and manage GitHub&#39;s documentation.<br>
<a href="https://help.github.com" rel="nofollow">https://help.github.com</a> is GitHub&#39;s second-most viewed site--after the main website itself. I&#39;d like to provide a somewhat opinionated look on how our valiant Documentation team writes and releases content for features on <a href="http://GitHub.com" rel="nofollow">GitHub.com</a> and GitHub Enterprise. I&#39;ll go over:<br>
How our teams (Development, Security, Docs, etc) coordinate before launching a feature<br>
The importance of opening pull requests early<br>
The review/edit cycle with peers<br>
How we incorporate DITA best practices into our Markdown documentation<br>
Validating content through CI and automated tests<br>
How we incorporate feedback from our users</p>
