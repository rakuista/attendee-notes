Entry points and guide posts: Janet Swisher

open docs - docs tht people outside your team can modify

contributor - anyone who modifies your docs

Some of the info in Mozilla's wiki was inherited from Netscape.

MDN is referred to as "Shared knowledge for the Open Web"

The MDN has been hosted on three different platforms:x:

- MediaWiki first, because that was the product of the time
- Mindtouch, but switched because they left out the translation people by accident, breaking all the localization workflows
- Kuma (KOO-mah) is their own wiki platform that they use now

If you don't make it clear what help you need or how to do it, people can't help you.

- Streamline the path from interest to success.

  Tell them how to do the thing and then point them to a list of things that need that thing done to them.

- Create invitations rather than roadblocks.

  Instead of saying "oops, we don't have this" ask folks to help create the things that need help or that don't exist.

- Expose what areas need help and in what ways.

  It's not just pointing out the things that need creating, it's also things like status pages and overviews and more. And it always includes pointing back to how to do the things that need doing.

- Improve the contributor experience.

  The visual design can improve contributions in unexpected ways. Example given? Changing the color of the edit button. Simple changes can increase your odds of getting edits.

Doc sprints and engaging with community started an upward trend in increasing number of editors per month. (Data is noisy but trending.)
