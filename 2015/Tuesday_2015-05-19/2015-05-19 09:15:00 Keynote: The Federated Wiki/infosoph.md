- federating
    - remembers history including links back to original
    - encourages what some people call plagiarism
        - a model for the future 
        - get over this ownership thing
    - inherit evolutionary improvements 
    - a chorus of voices
        - get the whole picture
- a wiki page includes 
    - a story full of items (content)
    - journal of history (who edited, when and where)
    - 'twins' (forks)
    - origin site
    - neighbors (sites browsed)
        - pulls in site map
        - searchable
