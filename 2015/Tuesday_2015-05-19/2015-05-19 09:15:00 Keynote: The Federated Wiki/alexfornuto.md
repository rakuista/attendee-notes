# The Federated Wiki


## Vision

### 1995

- Created the first Wiki



### 2015

- Change how people **write**, now wants to change how people **work**.
- Refactoring to ease improvement, and federation to ease sharing. 

## Inversion

Image of the traditional wiki and it's relation to web servers and the consumer.

Juxtaposed is an image of the idea of the federated wiki. Several wiki stacks that he says will be viewed as a single source by the web server.

... I really hope we can get a copy of the slides, describing this process of images will not do them justice.


refactoring vs. editing

federation vs. plagarism

# Editor

A single javascript browser application to open multiple wikipages side-by-side.
