The Federated Wiki: Ward Cunningham

Goal of the original wiki: reinvent the literature of programming, because ordinary things are as important as extraordinary things.

The community was committed to doing something new and there was a model that already existed.

Then Wikipedia took the wiki idea and really ran with it.

He's not exactly sure what's going to happen, where before it was a lot easier to predict.

Wikis have allowed us to uncover a simpler and more powerful internet.

Federation is the distributed evolution of knowledge.

Federated wikis seem a lot like a newsfeed, but it's also a place where you make things permanent.

Refactoring of info in a wiki isn't necessarily the same as editing.

Federation allows info to be free and by definition encourages plagiarism.

We're going to have to all get over this idea of ownership of knowledge.

Federation is a chorus of voices. Voices influence other groups, overlapping, but distinctive.
