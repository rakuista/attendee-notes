Continuous Deployment
---------------------

- development methodology
- get code changes out quickly and in small increments
    - get and respond to feedback
    - experiment in phases
- code is always production-ready
- requires a deployment pipeline
- possible to release multiple times per day
- not
    - the same as agile
    - continuous integration
    - continuous delivery

What this means for tech writers
--------------------------------

- uncertainty
    - unsure when a feature will be released
    - features can be released "magically"
- must be more efficient
    - adapt to change
    - fewer "big" releases
    - more to keep track of

How we adapted
--------------

- mental shift
    - features, not releases
    - aligns with customer mental model
- tooling can help
    - good process can help keep docs production-ready
    - scroll versions plugin
- doc MVP
    - means working in iterations
    - release notes > doc
    - notes, banners > rewrites
    - be transparent
    - feedback channels are vital
- kill doc debt
    - be ruthless about screenshots
    - be ruthless about isolating information (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - blitzes can be effective for big changes 
- balance control & freedom
    - lean process
    - don't let review hold things up
    - hire/empower the right people
- balance for iteration
- resource heavy content becomes exponentially harder to maintain
- velocity is hard to maintain in the long term
- What does MVD look like?
    - guidelines and ideas
    - single page release notes
    - in app help (comes with its own cost)
    - automate
