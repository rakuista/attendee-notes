- there's a lot of bad documentation out there
- we got an interview with ycombinator for DocHub.it
- writing documentation is hard, but it doesn't have to be. Really!
    - we provide tools
    - made a very mimimum viable product
- as a developer most of my life is spent reading documentation
- 6 months ago, we go in
- [readme.io](http://readme.io)
- I dislike writing documentation
    - it's a lot of work to get started
    - writing a basic http api is really simple
        - but it's easy to make assumptions and not document things
- english is ambigious
    - the API is written unambiguously
    - the implementation is written unambiguously
    - we try to bridge the gap with english
- generated docs are never good enough 
- people think good formatting makes good docs
- pollyanna principle
    - machines should do work
    - people should think
- Four types of documentation
    - Reference 
    - Examples/Tutorials
    - Topical Guides
    - Support (important but ignored)
        - PHP docs with comments
- Separation of duties
    - Computers are great for reference
    - Computers generate example code, Humans curate and add context
    - Humans can create guides, but community can help identify what's wrong
    - Support can be the wild west, keep support open so the community can contribute
- O'Reilly-ification of Documentation
    - they're great but they're monolithic
    - they have to cover everything
- Start tailoring to users
- Onboarding
    - Minimum viable call (get them doing something as quickly as possible)
    - Learn, install, MVC, next steps
- Interactive playgrounds
    - try something without much risk of error
- Dashboards should be front and center
- Error messages
    - Angular puts a URL that brings you to the docs for the error
- API SDKs 
- Support section
    - support is the biggest threat to documentation
- Technology can't replace humans but we can use it to do what it's good at
