Developer's Approach to Docs: readme.io

Most of my life is spent looking at documentation or working with it.

ReadMe.io is the company. Documentation is vitally important but there may be a better way to go about it. It's a lot of work to get started even before you can get to writing the first line.

Twilio and Jango cited as fantastic docs to emulate. Also Stripe's docs. But remember: just because it looks the same, doesn't mean it's good docs.

English is ambiguous but it's not the best language to use to write the documentation.

Jacob Kaplan Moss: It takes a lot of thought to write documentation well.

Reference, Examples, Guides, Support are the four types of docs.

Which "flow" people want in docs depends on how many times they've seen the docs and the product. Use this to tailor info for them.
