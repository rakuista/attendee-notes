Designing Information for Growth: Marya DeVioto

Not about writing docs for companies that are growing. It's about confronting complication and audiences. It's about the choices (battles, commitments) you make and why as your information base grows and your company grows.

The aspiration to create perfection is compromised by the fact that we're human and all different. There's no perfect way.

As soon as you amass info in your company people will begin to use it in different ways. There's overlap in how people use our docs. It's a complex web, messy and tangled and difficult to tease apart.

Make your choices knowingly. As soon as you write a single word of your docs you've chosen something.

- Descriptive docs - how does it work, what does it do, why do I want it. Loved by sales, marketing, legal. It shows a concrete experience, but it's hard to maintain (e.g., screenshots). Takeaway: Don't create clutter that your users need to search through.
- Defensive docs - oh no it went wrong, let's defend ourselves against what users might sue us over (e.g., FAQs are big defensive docs). Loved by Support, Docs, Software Design. Defensive docs are frequently about edge cases. Frequently used as a bandaid for poor design or dev practices. Hard to figure out where it goes. Sounds like bad news.
- Procedural docs - answers the how do i questions and how those tasks are related to each other, plus what are the best practices. Loved by Docs and Support. Very useful for how to move between multiple environments and platforms, something no other type of docs can do. Best use? Uncovers dramatic gaps in development. But...they're BORING. Hated by Sales (because you're creating clutter through repeated steps).
- Tutorials - anything that takes you through a process. It shows a fully worked out example and shows users how they'll know when they've got a good grasp on things. Users will have done a thing, possibly even have a product. Loved by Docs, Devs, Select Users IF THEY'RE DONE WELL. It's immersive, empowering, and motivating. They should be used to teach people the best order in which to learn things. They're also very hard to generalize. Hated by anyone who doesn't agree with the format, direction, or example.
