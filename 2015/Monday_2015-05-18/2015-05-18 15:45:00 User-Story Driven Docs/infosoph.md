- Stop documenting UI, start documenting user-stories

Why documenting UI is bad
-------------------------

- you are creating siloed view of your platform
- but users want to know how to combine the actions of your UI to do something
- if you focus on UI, you're delegating the task of building a mental model
    - you combine reference with tutorial docs
    - docs are the first line of support
- it's hard to prioritize your work
- UI is under constant change

Check if your documenting the UI
--------------------------------

- Users can't connect the dots
- Everything feels like reference
- Lots of doc pages state the same information
- Pageviews are flat
- Huge maintenance backlog

How we started to change
------------------------

- new project, new approach
- identified user stories with documentation and support
    - document user stories, not UI
- docs ready on beta
- positive customer feedback
- easy to prioritize work
- discussions were easier
- but we lacked process

Our current process
-------------------

- Kick-off: agree on user stories
- Decide when to document
- Implement the user stories with the new features
- Draft & Feedback
- Polish & Feedback

What we learned
---------------

- use smaller projects as an opportunity to start change
- be the change
- stop being inconsistent
- user stories make us better developer advocates
    - convinced developers not develop some features
- receiving positive feedback
