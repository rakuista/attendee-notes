Scenario-based docs: Matt Ness

Doc set small and easy when he joined. Just one core product with just a few manuals set up by role or tasks. Technically sophisticated problem solvers. Loved challenge. Hung out in IRC channel and forums.

Now customers not as sophisticated or have time to solve things, but same complex problems. Feedback forms on every topic. Input from everyone but most are doc improvements. Simple instructions for complex tasks seems most requested.

Tutorials to start out but there needs to be better docs to go beginner-intermediate-expert. "There is a chasm that needs to be bridged." Tutorials might work which will give basic pre-reqs and starts them out but doesn't do more than get them familiar with more than just the basics. They need more help.

Conceptual overview might work too, with cool diagrams. With lots of links to the more detailed info. Or procedural info. Task oriented topics might work too, as long as there's decent table of contents. But these aren't always helpful to taking users over the chasm. Scenario-based docs would help in this case.

Tell an instructional story that goes further than a tutorial. It knows who it's talking to. It assumes certain basic knowledge. Tells customer how to get a complex task done that helps them take on similar tasks in the future.

RPG analogies. Docs are storytelling much like DnD. The player's handbook is the user manual of DnD. The DM's guide is the admin manual/SDK. And the modules are scenario-based docs. The game lives and dies by how playable it is.

If you provide users with enough choices or merely the apperance of enough choices, they don't even realize it's happening.

Splunk realized large-scale scenario-based material. Hard to keep up with. Pro-serve groups took it into their own hands via presentations. Most customers aren't up to that challenge so it was just what the company was looking for. They created docs for this as part of a hack-week draft. They use note information in the sidebars during draft, but got incorporated into the main docs at go-live.

Each scenario-based doc has a goals section that describes the end goal and pre-reqs. Each stage is broken down into easily digestible groups of procedures based on cognitive leaps.

Best practices:

- know your customers and know the problems they're trying to solve
- developer customer profiles and pitch the scenario to that
- don't write a tutorial because it's beyond that
- don't write a marketing case study
- KISS with simple procedures for a complex process (use info links to primary doc set)
- use video strategically for illustration only, as a supplement
- have fun with it
