- in the early days documenting was easy
    - one product, five manuals, FAQ, and release notes
    - technically sophisticated users
- now
    - more products
    - more manuals
    - more users with different skills and needs
- we solicit user feedback
- we have a chasm that must be bridged
    - beginner..intermediate..expert
- how to guide users through "the dark forest"
    - tutorial
        - doesn't get people much more than the basics
    - conceptual overview
    - procedural
        - task oriented 
        - users piece together
    - none of these help the users make the leap
- tell a story with scenario-based docs
    - similar to a tutorial
    - provides deeper details
    - anticipates common problems 
- you are either a self-identified nerd or "Nerd Adjacent"
- game master/dungeon master tells a story that the players participate in 
- D&D is heavily documented
    - monster manual
- The player's handbook is the user's manual 
- the dungeon master's guide is the admin manual/SDK
- the adventures are scenario-based docs
- bad RPG writing = bad RPG experience
- Railroading: provide enough choices, or the appearance of choices, they don't realize they're being led down a specific path
    - nobody wants to feel like a puppet
    - the story has to be good enough that people don't mind being on rails
    - learn where your users want to go and then tell them a story that leads them there
- Scenario-based docs are the stories beyond the tutorial
- clarify the goals and things that must be completed to achieve goals
- best practices
    - know your customers 
    - develop customer profiles (personas?)
    - don't write a tutorial (help solve big problems)
    - don't write a marketing case study
    - simple procedures for a complex process (don't give unnecessary details)
    - video is for illustration not documentation
    - have fun
