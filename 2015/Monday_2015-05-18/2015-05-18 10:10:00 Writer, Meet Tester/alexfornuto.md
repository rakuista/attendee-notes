# Writer, Meet Tester

A writer and a tester (quality engineer), working for Saleforce on the API. The tester spends time writing testing code, thinking about the ways the user will user (or misuse -ed.) their API. The writer works with the testers, and also creates all forms of guides.

- Both are strong customer advocates, with a deep sense of customer empathy.
- They are the first users.
