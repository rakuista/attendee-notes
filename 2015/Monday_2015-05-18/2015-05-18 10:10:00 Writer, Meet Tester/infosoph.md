Writer, meet tester
===================

- trailhead = interactive learning path
- good tester is a strong customer advocate
- good tech writer is a strong customer advocate
- always answer questions with a link to the doc or create new docs based on those questions
- tester would find problems too late in the design cycle

API Design Review Board
-----------------------

1. Document template to match spec
2. Review among stakeholders (discussion within google doc)
3. Approval meeting (chance to achieve consensus on unresolved issues)

- advocate for using language for external audience, not internal names familiar to developers

Simulating the real world
-------------------------

- code samples
- actually say, "Why would a customer use this?" forces you think from the customer's perspective
- dogfooding: use internal docs when doing testing
- blitzing: coordinated attack on a certain aspect of the code
  - file doc bugs when things are unclear 

Working in the real world
-------------------------

- troll the forums to see if people are finding and understanding the information they need
- direct exposure to customers improves ux design: could be applied to docs too
- only look at questions that have been answered
  - was it answered with a link to the docs? if not, add a link.
  - is the doc missing? file a bug
