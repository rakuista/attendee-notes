Documentation in a Continuous Deployment World: Christine from Atlassian

Changes to the way they work:

- Think less about when and more about what is changing. Think about features, not releases. It's all about getting your features in your deployed product.
- The right processes can help keep docs production-ready. It's vital to be able to adapt to changes quickly.
- The MVP for docs often means shipping in iterations. Release notes > docs. Notes and banners in content > rewrites. Key takeaway: reach customers where they're looking for help.
- Kill your doc debt. Screenshots are a pain to stay on top of. Say things once. Blitzes are good for big changes.
- Keep doc processes lean so writers can respond more quickly. Docs may not be 100% right for 100% of the users 100% of the time AND THAT'S OK.
- Resources and velocity become key. Think carefully when you invest in these things because they're hard to maintain.

- Let your writers make judgement calls about minimum viable docs with short guidelines and ideas.
- MVD may be in-app help, covering 80% of customer questions, but it's expensive. Figure out when is the best time to do it. When is the cost worth it?
- Define a documentation pipeline so that info about features happens at the same time as feature code, and is targeted for the right users.
