# Keynote - Marcia Johnston

## Who are you?

We are all Abbot and Costello

## My first tech-comm project

1983. The Police are new stars. Karen Szymanski hired Marcia as a technical writer intern. Magna Vox CaTV has her rewrite The Magna 6400 User Guide. Karen had a reader go through it, and Marcia sat behind her to observe.

Marcia made the assumption that the reader knew to point the remote *at* the TV.

## Things that get in the way of clear communication.

- See the slide, it's a long list.

## The Hubble Space Telescope

A 1.3 mm fault that was essentially caused by stress.

## The Miracle Worker

## 1Password

The master password should be something easy to remember. Here's a great [comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) on the subject.
