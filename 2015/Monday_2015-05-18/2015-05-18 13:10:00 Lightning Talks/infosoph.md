Rackspace
---------

- moving from multiple doc tools to RST with automated builds in Jenkins
- eating the elephant one bite a time

iPython/Jupiter
---------------

- iPython notebooks
- interactive documents
- we need your help!
    - we need docs for the project
    - multiple audiences
        - journalists

    - improve our own tools
    - we have money!

Better web docs
---------------

1. screenshot tutorials
    - no context
    - pain to update
2. video tutorials
    - paint to update
3. text
    - TL;DR

- 2 window issue => Cognitive Load
- Too expensive to update => Doubt

- Guide tour/walkthroughs solve the problem similary to GPS
- [walkHUB](http://walkhub.net) is our open source walkthrough product built on Selenium

Software Requirements
---------------------

- What are the requirements?
    - paper?
    - word?
    - bugtracker?
    - some database?
    - pay some vendor?
    - functional tests?
    - unit tests?
    - the code is the documentation!?
- Why do we have requirements?
    - devs: know what we're building
    - managers: coordinate
    - marketing: what is our product?
    - impress auditors
- Who are the requirements for?
    - maybe the "requirements" aren't just one thing
    - theory of operation
    - backlog for marketers
- How do we pull this all together?

Using stories
-------------

- screenwriting is technical writing
    - give people a whole world
    - pack a lot of information into that
- joseph campbell's story arc
- use that as a metaphor to help users 

Turn your docs into books
-------------------------

- You make a living writing docs
- You don't hear from your readers
- Take your docs, turn them into a pdf and charge money, people will read your docs
- if it's online, people don't value it
- if they give you even a dollar for 60 pages, they will **read it**

Email
-----

- make it suck less
    - organization
    - ease of information
    - grabs attention
- don't have a wall of text
- don't have it too short either ("You've wasted one of my email points")
- know your audience
- middle length
- provide structure (beginning, middle, end)
- bullet points!!!!!
- use gifs
- Linux Users Group from Corvallis, Oregon
