<p>Companies spend big bucks developing content to attract and retain customersmost of it, forgettable. In fact, according to some cognitive scientists, people remember only 10 percent of what you say. The other 90 percent is forgotten. To make matters worse, the 10 percent that people remember differs between members of your audience.<br>
Imagine the time and money we could all save if we knew how to control what our audiences remember about our content, if we could break through all of the distractions with content so compelling that our audiences couldnt ignore our message.<br>
In a blog that I wrote, I had the opportunity to interview Dr. Carmen Simon. A co-founder of Rexi Media, Dr. Simon holds doctorates in instructional technology and cognitive psychology. We explored how science could help us design memorable content.<br>
In my Write the Docs presentation, Ill share five scientifically-based techniques that the audience can apply to their own content and presentations to make them more memorable and influential. This presentation will be based on information from my interview with Dr. Simon and other sources.</p>
