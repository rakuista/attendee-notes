The Science of Creating Unforgettable Content: @karenronning

Unforgettable content starts with getting your audience's attention.

Forgetting is nature's spam filter. Unimportant information is forgotten.

What can you do to boost the memory of the importan stuff that audience's should remember and act upon.

1. Identify your content goals. "What do I want my audience to remember?"
1. Focus the attention of your audience. "Audiences have to sacrifice something to remember something and they'll all remember something different unless you help them focus."
1. Differentiate the important stuff.
1. Less is more. Get rid of the extra words so the audience doesn't lose the message in the weeds of your prose.
1. Encode stronger memories. Words have power. Story telling is a powerful way to help people remember. We're hardwired to do it.
1. Engage your audience.
1. Spark! Action with emotion. Most business docs rely too heavy on analytical information and not the emotion that powers retention.

Awe, anger, and anxiety get the most shares. Sad gets negative shares.
