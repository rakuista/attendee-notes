# How to Wride Docs for Users that Don't Read

- Why people don't read your documentation
- Why your Docs are are awesome.
- 

## No one reads anything on the internet.

Users scan in an F-shaped pattern.

- Meaningful texts and images
- The beginnings of Paragraphs (first 3-5 words)
-
-

## Examples

Fixed width unformatted text VS Markdown or other formatted text

Red Callout box is viewed as ad, often skipped.

Search Failure - lacking code snippets or other differentiations of important information.

Breaking up Content - GitHub as an example.

Table of contents - Heroku as example. Move the important keywords to the front of the line.

**Users are awful at searching**

Example:
	Your user asks - How do I forward a number?

	Your guide says - How to do everything with your phone.


**No one reads above or below code snippets**


Docs behind a Login Wall won't be searchable.

Downloading PDF Docs are hard to find, search, view, etc.

Confusing error messages don't help solve problems. 

## You can Fix these!

Strings are easy to find/change.


1.  Missed the title

- Break up the text often
- First 3-5 words are the most important per paragraph
- ... He's going faster than I can type :)


2.  Care about SEO

** Every Page is a Landing Page**

- URLs should describe the Content.


3.  Making it better.

- Look at your product from a user/task-driven perspective.
- Users should "hire" things you control for most failures.
