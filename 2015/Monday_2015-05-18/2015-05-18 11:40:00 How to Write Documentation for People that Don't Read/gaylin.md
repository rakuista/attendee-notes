Docs for peeps that don't read: Kevin Burke

People don't read docs. How Users Read on the Web - Jakob Nielsen is still relevant today.

People don't read; they scan in an F-shaped pattern. There's a lot of info being completely ignored.

They're not looking at big blocks of text. They look at meaningful text, images, and code; variants in type, lists, and links.

Comprehension is greater when users can scan the docs that are well-formed. They never read the whole thing, so make it count.

People tend to skip over the things that look like an ad. Iconography can help with that. Responsive design (to make text narrower to help them scan).

Consider using expandable content for stuff you don't need to read but further explains stuff.

Users are bad at searching. They don't try other queries; they just give up and assume it's not there. Everyone has a different mental model based on the phase of their growth with your topic. Think about the types of words your users are using. Match your text to that. Read through your Google Analytics search logs and match your text to that.

No one reads anything above or below code snippets. So put your instructions right in the snippets themselves. Try to make them immediately runable from the snippet.

Every user failure is a potential job to be done. Remember that users are going to try to copy-pasta to Google so try to make your docs show up at the top of the search. Fix the things where users are going. Check Wiki How. Don't let other groups steal your traffic. Your docs should be Wiki How. Your docs should be Stack Overflow. Or create an answer in Stack Overflow that directs you to your docs.

Put the exact text of your errors into your docs. It helps your SEO.

Improve error messages so users won't even need to go to Google. Tell them exactly what to do. Strings are really easy to search for. Those are easy to find/change. And it's a great way to get started with your code base.
